# Open Source Cookbook
This small project was started with the idea of appling open source principles
to cooking. I find it strange that we treat recipes as some static blueprint
forever frozen in a cookbook or recipe website. In reality, recipes are about
learning, adjustments, and discovery. Anyone from the GitHub community is
welcome to add content and share their favorite recipes with others.

## Contributing Guide
Contributing is easy. Simply submit a markdown file containing four items:
- Title
- Ingredients
- Directions
- Notes

You are welcome to improve an existing recipe or add a new one of your own.
