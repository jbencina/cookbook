# Stove Top Beef Stew
## Ingredients
- 1-2 lbs. beef chuck, cubed
- 2 sticks celery, chopped
- 3 carrots, chopped
- 3 yellow potatoes, diced
- 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2-3 cups beef broth
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1/2 cup flour
- Olive oil, as needed
- 2 Bay leaves
- Salt
- Pepper
- Oregano
- Thyme
- Splash of fish sauce
- Splash of soy sauce

## Directions
1. Toss beef with flour and spices (to taste) in zip-loc bag until evenly coated.
2. Coat bottom of pan in olive oil and bring to medium heat.
3. Brown beef on all sides without crowding (< 5 minutes).
4. Remove beef. Sprinkle celery, onion, and carrots with salt and sautee until onions have become brown and translucent. 
5. Add and sautee garlic for 1-2 minutes.
6. Use 1/2 cup of broth to deglaze bottom of pot, scraping up all brown bits.
7. Pour 1/2 cup of broth in another container and whisk any extra flour in bag until smooth. Add into pot with vegetables and cook for 1-2 minutes until thickened.
8. Add back beef, potatoes, bay leaves, spices, and enough broth to cover everything without making too watery.
9. Cook 1.5 to 2 hours on low heat with lid-on and occasional stirring.
10. Add a splash of fish sauce and soy sauce for richer flavor. Be careful not to over season by tasting after each splash.

## Notes
- Fish & soy sauces help add umami depth to the stew
- Stew will continue to thicken once cooled
